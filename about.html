        <p id="title">About NaMie</p>
        <p id="text">NaMie, a project born from the enthusiasm of four students from SMP Palembang Harapan, has transformed from a simple idea about the beauty of Indonesian cuisine into a rapidly growing venture. Our main focus is to provide a special culinary experience through ready-to-cook sauces and seasonings, designed to make cooking easier for consumers. Currently, NaMie specifically offers our flagship products in the field of Fried Rice and Fried Noodles.</p>
        <p id="text">We chose the culinary field because we believe in the immense potential of the creative economy. You've probably heard of the term Creative Economy. It's a collection of 17 subsectors focused on developing Indonesia's economy through intelligence and creativity. Indonesia is renowned for its natural beauty and cultural diversity. However, attention to the culinary subsector is still limited. We feel it's crucial to bring more attention to the diversity and deliciousness of Indonesian cuisine, both domestically and internationally.</p>
        <p id="text">We hope that our products and venture won't just become famous among Indonesian folks but also among international communities. We also aim to increase people's interest in local products and introduce the unique flavors of Indonesia worldwide. With our commitment to quality and innovation, we're confident that our products will capture the hearts not only domestically but also internationally.</p>
